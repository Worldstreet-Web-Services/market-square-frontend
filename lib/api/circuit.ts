/**
 * The client's circuit breaker: what stops an outage becoming a storm.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The app polls — stream presence, chat, unread, messages,
 * notifications — and every query retries twice on failure, and every request
 * goes through a Vercel function that waits on the upstream before giving up.
 * When the backend went down, those three multiplied: a poll that fires every
 * few seconds, times three attempts, times a function that sits there holding
 * memory until it times out, times every open tab. The clients did not notice
 * the backend was gone; each request found out on its own, over and over.
 *
 * A breaker makes that a shared fact. Once enough requests in a row have
 * failed the same way, the circuit OPENS and every subsequent call fails
 * instantly, in-process, with no network and no function invocation. One probe
 * is allowed through per cooldown to find out whether it is back.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A FAILURE is deliberately narrow: transport errors and 5xx.
 * A 401, a 404 or a validation error is the server working correctly and
 * telling us something — tripping on those would take the whole app down over
 * one bad request.
 *
 * Pure and framework-free so the state machine can be tested directly; the
 * clock is injected for the same reason.
