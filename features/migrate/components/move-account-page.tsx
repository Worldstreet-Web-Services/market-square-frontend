/**
 * BRING YOUR OLD ACCOUNT — /move-account.
 *
 * Before the move to Decane, Square accounts lived on Privy, and a profile —
 * handle, followers, posts, likes, tips — is keyed to that old account. A
 * Decane sign-in is a new id, so without a link the reader arrives as a
 * stranger while their followers sit on an account they cannot sign into.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS THE OLD ACCOUNT FIRST, and that is the whole design. A
 * returning reader arrives wanting to sign in as themselves; asking them to
 * create a new account before proving who they are reads as being told their
 * account is gone. So: sign in to the old one, hear once that Square has moved,
 * set up the new sign-in, and the link fires ON ITS OWN — there is no button
 * for it.
 *
 * Doing it this way also closes a window. Signing in with the new account makes
 * an empty profile under the new id, which Square absorbs when the link
 * arrives — but only while nobody has touched it. Linking immediately after
 * that sign-in means nobody can. The other order left the reader loose in the
 * app with an empty account and a handle to invent, and inventing one refuses
 * the move for good.
 *
 * Reopening this page re-sends the link, which is how one that met a transient
 * outage gets finished (the call is idempotent by contract).
 *
 * This page DOES watch for the move to finish. It used not to — Square did not
 * report the re-key, so a recorded link was the end of the story here and the
 * profile was assumed to be there afterwards. Square now answers with
 * `rekey.square`, so the three cases that used to look identical are told
 * apart: done, still going, and refused because this account already has a
 * profile. Announcing success over that last one is how somebody loses their
 * followers quietly.
